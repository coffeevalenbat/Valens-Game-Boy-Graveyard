# txt2ht-message
This is a silly tool that can convert strings to hUGETracker clipboard data that, when compiled, outputs about the same string, it's not possible to write a full string through the editor since the note column only goes from values 0 through 72 (Which covers like, 4 letters of the ASCII alphabet).

Usage:
`python3 txt2ht-message.py "MESSAGE"`
